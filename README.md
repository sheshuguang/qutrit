# qutrit
量子三元（qutrit）是三种可能状态正交的量子叠加态的量子信息单元，量子三元（qutrit）是类似传统的三进制数位，类似两种可能状态的量子粒子量子比特，或类似于传统的比特。
unit of quantum information that exists as a superposition of three orthogonal quantum states; analogous to the classical trit, just as 
the qubit, a quantum particle of two possible states, is analogous to the classical bit

A qutrit has three orthogonal basis states, or vectors, often denoted {\displaystyle |0\rangle } |0\rangle , {\displaystyle |1\rangle } |1\rangle , and {\displaystyle |2\rangle } |2\rangle  in Dirac or bra–ket notation. These are used to describe the qutrit as a superposition in the form of a linear combination of the three states:
